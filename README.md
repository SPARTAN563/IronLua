#Sierra IronLua

This is a heavily modified branch of IronLua by fgretief. By "heavily modified" I mean that I am not attempting to follow any coding styles or paradigms used by the original author, rather attempting to get this branch to a usable state as quickly and efficiently as possible.

##Current Branch Goals
* Invariable Support
  This branch should provide support for invariable values to be placed in the engine's global table which should be immutable.

* Scoped Execution
  This branch should provide support for execution in different scopes, allowing for engine side global variables to be set without changing their original values.
  It should also allow variables to be set and retrieved using the standard ScriptScope functions.

* .NET Class Integration
  It should be possible to load a .NET class into an engine to provide it for the script. 
  This will make use of the *Invariable Support* to prevent functions and other immutable properties from being changed on the class.
  It will also rely on functions which will automatically create a metatable for the class.

##Possible Goals
These are things I'd like to implement eventually, however they are not at the top of my priorities list at the moment.

* Event Support
  Provide event handlers within Lua for C# events generated by classes (static) or by objects which are set either on the engine or scope level (instance).

* Integration into Master branch
  If I get around to it, and this becomes a nice stable branch, then I'll try and get the changes I've made merged into the master branch.
  This won't be a priority if the original author starts making more updates which break anything I've fixed here, but if there are no changes by the time I am done
  then I'll issue a pull request.

# IronLua

IronLua is intended to be a full implementation of Lua targeting .NET. Allowing easy embedding into applications and friction-less integration with .NET are key goals.

It's built with C# on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime.

Licensing has not been decided upon yet but it will be some form of [permissive free software license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence) for easy contribution and usage without any fuss.

## A work in progress

*This is very much a work in progress project and isn't near a usable state yet.*

* 2011-06-30<br/>
  Started work on lexer.

* 2011-07-05<br/>
  Lexer has all major functionallity and can lex entire Lua. Still some bugs that will be fixed while working on parser.<br/>
  Started work on parser.

* 2011-07-17<br/>
  Can parse entire Lua. Probably have lots of minor bugs that will be fixed when I pull in the test suites.<br/>
  Have begun reading up on DLR. Will probably take some time reading documentation of the DLR before I start working on the runtime and translation of the AST to DLR expressions.

  I have decided to rewrite the project in C#. It should be pretty straightforward to port.

* 2011-08-15<br/>
  Rewrite to C# is done. The rewrite was done for several reasons. The binary size is 4 times smaller, probably because of F#'s discriminated unions and closure's generated code among other things. Additionally tooling is alot better for C# and it is easier to reason about code performance because the IL generated is more easily mapped to C#.

  IronLua can now generate expression trees for its entire AST. Currently working on function invokation, specifically mapping arguments to parameters. It's a quite a complex process involving type coercion and casting, expanding varargs, using parameter and type default values if not enough parameters and wrapping overflowing arguments into "params" and Varargs parameters.<br/>
  After that I will start working on all the TODO comments and get proper exception and error code everywhere. Then it's time to implement the entire Lua standard library, some parts will probably be left unimplemented like parts of the debug package and coroutines might not be implemented for the 0.1.0 release. Finally I will create the test harness and hopefully find some useable test code I can bring in. And that's pretty much it for the 0.1.0 release. Full .NET integration and proper error messages/stack traces is slated for 0.2.0 and possibly 0.3.0.
